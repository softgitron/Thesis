		\hline
		\reid & First meeting & As a developer, I want to be able to mock components easily so that I can easily test parts in isolation. \\
		\hline
		\reid & First meeting & As a developer, I want to be able to setup database content easily so that I can concentrate on other aspect of the test writing. \\
		\hline
		\reid & First meeting & As a developer, I want to write tests for Angular-based frontend so the test framework must be compatible with angular.  \\
		\hline
		\reid & First meeting & As a developer, I want to be able to test \gls{api} interfaces using test automation so I can easily \gls{e2e} verify my backend changes. \\
		\hline
		\reid & First meeting & Test automation must be compatible with Windows-based development environment. \\
		\hline
		\reid & Meta Planning & As a developer, I want that tests are automatically run in the \gls{ci} pipeline so that I don't have to run all tests locally.\\
		\hline
		\reid & Interviews & As a customer, I want that the test code is fully separate from the production code so that there will not be accidental test code in the production code.\\
		\hline
		\reid & Interviews & As a test automation engineer, I want that test work independently of each other so they can be parallelised well and will not cause random failures so easily.\\
		\hline
		\reid & Interviews & As a developer, I want to have assertion helpers so that I can easily check the execution results.\\
		\hline
		\reid & Interviews & As a test automation engineer, I want that every assert contains a handwritten message so that it is easy to find assert, when an automation test case fails.\\
		\hline
		\reid & Interviews & As a developer, I want that the logging of the test automation is clear so I can easily understand what went wrong with the run.\\
		\hline
		\reid & Interviews & As a developer, I want that the logging of the test automation is broad so that I can easily understand what went wrong if the test case fails.\\
		\hline
		\reid & Interviews & As a developer, I want that different test automation frameworks have similarities so that I can just learn one framework and apply my knowledge to others.\\
		\hline
		\reid & Interviews & As a developer, I want that there is an easy way to trigger \gls{ci} pipeline runs and adjust run parameters.\\

		\reid & Survey & As a developer, I want that automation tests are easy to run so that I can concentrate on writing new test cases.\\
		\hline
		\reid & Survey & As a developer, I want that automation test environment is easy to setup so I do not have to waste time setting it up.\\
